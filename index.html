    <img src="./images/BANGAAA.jpg"  style="height:200px; width:200px" alt=" Banga Soup">

    <p> Banga soup is one of the best nourishing soups you can make with palm nut. All it takes is an assortment of spice flavorings, an assortment of meat and fish, and finishing it off with a touch of 'beletete' to elevate this soup. It’s an easy recipe that delivers terrific results!.While it is indigenous to the Deltas, both People from Edo state and all over the Niger Delta states also loved and enjoyed it.Nigerian Banga Soup or Ofe Akwu is native to the Niger Delta and the South Eastern parts of Nigeria.
        <br> In the Niger Delta areas, Banga soup is commonly eaten with various fufu recipes: Starch, Pounded Yam, Semolina, Garri and Cassava Fufu. In the South Eastern parts of Nigeria, Banga Soup is referred to as Ofe Akwu where Ofe means Soup / Stew and Akwu means palm fruit and is used mainly as stew for Boiled White Rice.
        The palm fruit oil extract used in cooking Banga Soup / Stew is quite different from the red palm oil used in cooking Nigerian food recipes. Palm Oil is pure oil extracted from the palm fruit pulp at high temperatures while the palm fruit oil extract used for the Banga Soup is extracted at a very low temperature and is a mixture of oil and water. Palm fruit oil extracted for Banga Soup contains less saturated fat than palm oils.</p> <br>

    <h2> The Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Start by grinding the spices. Add them all together (ataiko, Irugege and a cup of crayfish), blend to powder. Blend the pepper as well. Wash the dried fish and remove center bones. I used dried catfish. This catfish is actually my favorite, it tastes so wonderful in soups. You need just one. Pour hot water over it, wash and set aside.</li>
        <li> Wash and precook the prawn, use half a cup of water, a seasoning cube and a pinch of salt. <br>
            Precook your meat, this is how – Wash properly and use two seasoning cubes and a pinch of salt. Cook the meat until it becomes easy to chew, and the water is almost dried. Add salt to taste and allow another three minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Boil the palm fruit for 20 minutes, pound with a mortar and pestle, transfer into a bowl, add water and extract the juice, don’t add too much water, you want it thick. You will need about 7-10 cups of that palm fruit juice for this soup. It should be thick.</li>
            <li>Use a sieve to strain the extract into your cooked meat. <br>
                Allow boiling for 15 minutes with the pot half-covered. It should be a lot thicker now</li>
            <li>Add the cleaned dried fish, ground (crayfish, ataiko plus irugege), oburunbebe stick, ground pepper, and salt to taste. Cover and allow another 10 minutes. You can add a little water if it is too thick.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed dried beletientien leaves, precooked prawn, periwinkles and one cube of knorr. Stir, cover and allow to simmer for 3 minutes. This is how to make the popular banga soup that is loved and made by the Deltans.</li>
            <li>Serve with starch, eba or fufu.</li>
    </ul>
